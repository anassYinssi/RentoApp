# Rento - Cross-Platform Rental Application
Rento is a cross-platform mobile application designed to facilitate seasonal property rentals. The app allows property owners to list their homes, villas, apartments, or other types of accommodations, and provides users with a convenient way to search, view, and book properties. Built using Flutter, Rento offers a seamless experience on both Android and iOS devices.
